# Python YouTube Downloader

YouTubeDownloader is a Python script for downloading YouTube videos, playlists, and videos from channels with specified qualities. It features a user-friendly console interface with multi-select options for playlists, comprehensive download summaries, and disk space checks before downloads.

## Installation

1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Install required packages:

```bash
pip install pytube tqdm PyInquirer colorama
```

## Running The Script
```bash
python3 main.py
```

## Configuration
The script uses config.json for storing user preferences such as download path and default video quality. If the configuration file does not exist, the script will prompt for necessary information and offer to save it for future sessions.

```json
{
  "quality": "1080p",
  "download_path": "./downloads",
  "auto_download": [
    "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAYLIST_ID",
    "https://www.youtube.com/channel/CHANNEL_ID"
  ],
  "notification": "email" // or "slack"
}
```

The `"quality": "1080p"` sets the default video quality to 1080p for downloads. You can adjust this to other supported resolutions like 720p, 480p, etc, depending on your needs.

The `"download_path": "./downloads"` specifies the default path where the downloaded videos will be saved. You can change this to any valid directory path on your system.

### Storing Credentials
Create a .env file in the same directory as the script.

### Slack Notifications
```bash
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL='Slack_Webhook_URL'
```

### Email Notifications
For email notifications, you'll need to use SMTP. The SMTP server settings, username, and password should be stored in the .env file for security.

```bash
SMTP_SERVER='smtp.example.com'
SMTP_PORT=587
EMAIL_USERNAME='your_email@example.com'
EMAIL_PASSWORD='YourEmailPassword'
```
